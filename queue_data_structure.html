  <h1>Queue Data Structure</h1>
  <small>Feb 2th, 2020</small>
  <p>Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The
    order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the
    consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we
    remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.</p>

  <strong>Operations of Queue:</strong></br>
  Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:
  <li><b>Enqueue:</b> Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.</li>
  <li><b>Dequeue:</b> Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped i the same order in which they are pushed.
    If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Unerflow condition.</li>
  <li><b>Front:</b> Get the front item from queue.</i>
  <li><b>Rear:</b> Get the last item from queue.</li>

  <p><strong>Time Complexities of operations on Queue: </strong></br>
    In my implementation, Enqueue takes O(n) time as inserting into the 0th index of a list forces all the other items
    in the list to move one index to the right. Dequeue, Front (Peek), and Rear (not implemented) all take O(1) constant
    time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations.
  </p>

  <strong>Applications of Queue:</strong></br>
  <li>Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediatly, but have to be processed in First In First Out
    order like Breadth First Search.</li>
  <li>When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.</li>
  <li>When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two
    processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.</li>
